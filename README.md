# Multi-motif analysis
Analysis of the effect of several macro-, meso- and micro-structural descriptors of Caracoles' individual-based plant-pollinator multilayer networks (2020) on the fitness of their focal plant individuals. We downscaled the analysis of interactions based on motifs to the level of conspecific and heterospecific plant individuals.
