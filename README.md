# Multi-motif analysis
Analysis of the effect of several macro-, meso- and micro-structural descriptors of Caracoles' individual-based plant-pollinator multilayer networks (2020) on the fitness of their focal plant individuals. We downscaled the analysis of interactions based on motifs to the level of conspecific and heterospecific plant individuals.

# Calculating the total amount of homospecific and heterospecific triplets per week and pollinator: An example.

Given a network, we can decompose it into smaller subgraphs, called motifs. Here we estimated the amount of undirected triplets that were present in our visitation networks, that is, the pattern of connections of undirected path graphs with length 2 (see panels a and b in the figure above). In addition, we restricted our analysis to triplets with two plant individuals. 

One novel aspect of our work consisted in downscaling the analysis of interactions based on motifs to the level of conspecific and heterospecific plant individuals. Here we introduced a new triplet classification according to the plant species involved. If both focal plants belong to the same species, the triplet was referred to as homospecific motif (see the bee's motif that is highlighted in panel b); otherwise, the motif was classified as heterospecific (see the butterfly's motif that is highlighted in panel b).

To incorporate speciesâ€™ phenological overlap in our motif analysis, we calculated both types of triplets from the bipartite networks that arose weekly (see panel a for an example of such networks). Thus, heterospecific triplets only appear when different coflowering species that shared pollinators are present in a given week. Here, we show how to estimate total amount of homo- and of heterospecific triplets per week and floral visitor for a given plant.

To run the this example I will use the functions in `R_Scripts/functions.R` and the data in `Example/example.csv`. The metadata in `Example/example.csv` can be described as follows:
* Plot: network/site/year ID.
* Subplot: plant individual ID.
* Plant: plant species ID.
* ID: visitor species ID.
* Visits: number of visits recorded between the plant individual and the visitor species.
* Week: number of the week.

In the figure below we show the information in `Example/example.csv`.
